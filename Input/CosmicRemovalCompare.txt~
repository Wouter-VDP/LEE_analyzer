-> MCC87 is a very little bit better than MCC86 
-> New Cosmic removal has a little lower passing rate (1.5%) but higher purity results in increased passing rate for neutrino's
-> I checked the flash window, 3.2-4.8 is good!
-> Maybe uboonecode _11 vs uboonecode_12? NO, checked with Roberto's sample
-> The amount of events passing the optical filters stay the same!
